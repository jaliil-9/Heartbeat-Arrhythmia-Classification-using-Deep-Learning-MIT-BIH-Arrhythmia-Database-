# Heartbeat-Arrhythmia-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-MIT-BIH-Arrhythmia-Database-
This repository contains the code for a deep learning project aimed at predicting heartbeat arrhythmia classes using a custom model built with a combination of 1D CNN, BiGRU and Dense layers. The model is trained and evaluated on six classes from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
